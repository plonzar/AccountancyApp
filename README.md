# AccountancyApplication
My Application is designed do manage invoices and customers. I created it using ASP.NET Core and Angular 2.
Angular part is in ClientApp folder. I made angular code using VS Code so there are some //#region and
//#endregion tags to make some parts of code collapsible and more convenient to read.
If you would like to use this application on your computer, you should change connection string, and update
database with migrations that are in this project.
