# AccountancyApplication
My Application is designed do manage invoices and customers. I created using ASP.NET Core and Angular 2.
Angular part is in ClientApp folder. I made angular code using VS Code so there are some //#region and
//#endregion tags to make some parts of code collapsible and more convenient to read.
